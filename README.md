Georeferenced information on foraging opportuinities on public land on Pico Island.

Foraging is the act of searching for wild resources such as plants, fungi, fruit, roots, barks and nuts to use as food or medicine. It is a great way to spend time outdoors, interact with nature, and even teach your children that food is not grown in the supermarket and that not all medicine comes from a pharmacy.

Here on Pico Island in the Azores archipelago, there is free food being grown by nature all over the island on public land, and a lot of it is not harvested.

This site is supposed to function as a treasure map for Pico, to which anyone can add information about the localization of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants suitable for foraging.
